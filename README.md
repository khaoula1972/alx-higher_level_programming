## Plagiarism for SE Students in ALX

_Reminder :_ 
- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks in ALX projects yourself to meet with the learning objectives.
- You will not be able to meet the objectives of this program by copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

If you're a SE ALX Student, I firstly want to congratulate you on chosing this path and I want to remind you that as a SE Student myself that copy-paste rule won't get us anywhere far in this competitive industry so please be careful and always remember : "Always do the hard work !"
