## Plagiarism for SE Students in ALX

_Reminder :_ 
- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks in ALX projects yourself to meet with the learning objectives.
- You will not be able to meet the objectives of this program by copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

If you're an SE ALX Student, I want to first congratulate you for choosing this path. I'd also like to remind you that, as an SE Student myself, the copy-paste rule won't take us very far in this competitive industry. So, please be cautious and always remember: "Always do the hard work!"
